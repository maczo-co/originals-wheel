# maczo Originals — Wheel · Provably Fair

Welcome. This wiki explains how every **Wheel** result on [maczo.co](https://maczo.co) is provably
fair — and how *you* can verify it yourself, with no need to trust us.

Originals share one **commit-first** design: we lock in a secret **server seed** and publish its hash
*before* you bet, so we cannot change the outcome after seeing your bet. Every result is a pure function
of three values you can inspect, mapped by this game's **published odds**.

## The three inputs

| Value | Who controls it | When you see it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Server seed** | maczo (secret) | its **SHA-256 hash** is shown *before* you bet; the raw seed is revealed when you **Rotate** |
| **Client seed** | **you** (editable) | always |
| **Nonce** | server counter, +1 per bet | shown for each bet |

**Your bet inputs (params).** This game takes: `segments`, `risk` — pass them as the `params` JSON, keys exactly as your bet history shows them.
